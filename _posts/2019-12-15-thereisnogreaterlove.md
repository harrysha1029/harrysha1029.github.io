I rediscovered Amy Winehouse's music recently, and have been obsessed. I really like her album _Frank_, and her live performances. One of my favorites is her live version of _There is No Greater Love_ in the Janice Long Session (on the Frank B-Side). 

Here is a transcription and analysis of the guitar part.
