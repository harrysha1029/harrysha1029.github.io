Theo Katzman is currently my favorite songwriter. I really like his musical style, with most of his songs containg some combination of his insane vocals, acoustic guitar, distorted electric guitar, fender bass, drums, piano/keyboard. Some of his songs are funky and upbeat, and others are more sentimental and moving. A big reason I enjoy his songs so much are the lyrics, which can be funny, involve clever wordplay/rhymes, and create interesting imagery. These are my favorite lyrics from each song in his albums: _"Romance Without Finance"_, _"Heartbreak Hits"_, and _"Modern Johnny Sings: Songs in the Age of Vibe"_.

>    Turns out that freedom's just the price of admission, yeah

### Growing, Growing, Gone
>    You were so tiny and growing, growing, growing\\

>    And then one day you were gone\\
>    Gone into the life that was meant for your style

### Brooklyn
>    True like New York, but you lie like L.A\\

>    And on your hand I see that there's a ring\\
>    And I would understand\\
>    If I had put that ring upon your hand\\

### What Did You Mean (When You Said Love)
