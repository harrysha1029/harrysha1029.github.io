## Intro
Here are some notes from Berklee's Harmony Course. You can find the course PDFs [here](http://davidvaldez.blogspot.com/2006/04/berklee-jazz-harmony-1-4.html).

## Intervals
### Inverting Intervals
* 9 minus original interval = inversion interval
* Major and minor swap
* Diminished and augmented swap
* Perfect remains perfect

### Tensions
* 1, 3, 5, 7 are chord tones
* 9, 11, 13 are possible tensions
* Tensions that are a major 9th above a chord tone will sound the best

| Tension | Available on..|
| ---  | --- |
|9 |All chords (when diatonic to the key)|
|b9 and/or #9 |Dom7; rarely dom7sus4|
|11 |All forms of minor chords (including -7b5)|
|#11 |Maj7 and Maj6 when diatonic; dom7; +7|
|b13/#5 |m7b5; dom7|
|13 |Maj7; -(maj7); dom7; dom7sus4|

## Diatonic Harmony

### Chord Progression/Root motion
* Any diatonic chord may progress to any other diatonic chord
* Strongest diatonic root motion is movement down in 5ths
* Root motion down in 4ths is also strong but not as strong 
* Stepwise root motion is more subtle than root motion of 4ths and 5ths
* Movement down in 3rds is more common that movement up in thirds

### Sus4
* Sus4 chords can be thought of as have a subdominant upper structure over a dominant root
* II-7/V and IVmaj7/V are both versions of the sus4 chord 

### Diatonic Reharmonization
* 3 categories of diatonic chords
    * Tonic: I, III, VI
    * Subdominant: II, IV
    * Dominant : V, VII
* Any chord may be substituted with any other chord in the same functional category
* However, some reharmonizations sound better than others due to changes in root motion

## Secondary Dominants
* Definition:
    * Secondary dominants are non-diatonic and have at least one chord tone that is NOT in the key
    * They are expected to resolve to a diatonic chord a perfect 5th below
    * They are built upon a diatonic root
* A dominant chord can resolve to any quality of chord a perfect 5th lower except a diminished 7th chord
* The chord of resolution can therefore by any diatonic chord in a major or minor key
* Analysis: V7/II → II (Five 7 of two)
* Available tensions: 
    * Must be diatonic and a major 9th above a chord tone
    * b9 is available if it is diatonic
    * b13 is available if diatonic
    * b9 and #9 may coexist if either is diatonica

## Harmonic Rhythm
* Number of beats per chord within a progression.
* Commonly 2, 4, and 8 in 4/4 time
* Commonly 3 and 6 in 3/4 time
* Chords will receive strong or weak stress, depending upon their placement. This relative strength or stress will often determine the chord’s function
* In a grouping of 4 pulses the order of strength from smallest to largest is 4, 2, 3, 1
* SWsw
* Cadences usually occur from a weak beat to a stronger beat

## Extended Dominants
* Dominant chords which are on strong stress points will not sound as secondary dominants. The typical locations for these chords is either the beginning of a phrase or the beginning of the second half of a phrase
* Such chords are ‘extended dominants’ and have an expectation to resolve down a perfect fifth to another extended dominant or any diatonic chord
* They differ from secondary dominants on two features
    * Extended dominants are either found on a strong stress
    * They are continuations of an extended dominant pattern which starts with an extended dominant
* Each extended dominant in a series is the V7/V in a key of the moment. 
* A deceptive resolution occurs if a secondary dominant resolves down to an extended dominant.

## Melodic Analysis
* Most melodies consist of a repeated phrases. Some common forms are AABA, ABAC, ABCA, ABA, ABABAC..etc
* Most phrases can be broken down into three parts
    * Antecedent - the first half of the phrase which requires a:
    * Consequent - the second half of the phrase which may end with a:
    * Melodic Cadence - movement to a point of rest.
* An exception to phrase repetition is through-composed songs which typically use motivic repetition instead of phrase repetition.
* Motif manipulations:
    * Transposition
    * Inversion (Upside down)
    * Retrograde (Backwards)
    * Rhythmic Variation
    * Interval Variation
* Analysis: enclose motifs in brackets
* A note in a melody will either be an available pitch or an approach note

### Approach Notes
* Approach notes are notes which are a quarter note or less in duration and moves by step to a chord tone or available tension. 
* Passing tones are approach notes which move by step between two chords tones, between two available tensions, or between a chord tone and tension
    * If a passing tone is diatonic it is analyzed as a ‘scale’ approach note (S)
    * If it is not, it is analysed as ‘chromatic’ (CH)
    * Passing tones are analysed relative to the chord of resolution
* Unprepared approach notes do not have preparatory pitch but still resolve. They are preceded by a rest, a leap or a rhythmically repeated pitch.
* Neighbour tones are upper or lower movement from an available pitch and back to the same pitch (scale or chromatic step)
* Double chromatic approach - consecutive chromatic motion in the same direction to a note of resolution
* Indirect resolution - Two approach notes appear, one above the note of resolution and one below. 

### Special Situations
* Anticipation - A melody pitch occurring a ½ beat prior to a stressed beat (1 or 3). These are analysed relative to the chord that they anticipate
* Delayed attack - Opposite of anticipation. 
* Melodic suspension - A melody pitch which is tied into a different chord change for a beat or less. They are analyzed as the chord tone or tension of the first chord.

## Voice Leading
* Pitches in a chord (except the root) should move to the nearest chord tone of the subsequent chord following an order of preference:
    * Common tone (no movement)
    * Half-step movement
    * Whole-step movement
    * Movement in thirds (major or minor)
* Starting position of a chord progression is determined by sound; the best location for the chord tones is within the following range:

### Guide Tone Lines
* Guide tone lines are single lines which are developed by the voice leading of the essential chord tones and guide the listener through the chord progression. They are the result of voice leading the essential chord tones (1, 3, 7).
* If the developing guide tone line appears to be approaching the limits of the given range, an adjustment may be made utilizing one of the following alternatives
    * Within the duration of the chord, it is possible to leap from a guide tone to either:
        * The same guide tone an octave higher
        * Another guide tone line
    * Or voice leading may be suspended and the line started again at a different pitch level either
        * Following a cadence to the I chord, or
        * At the end of a phrase

## Minor Harmony

### Natural Minor
* Shares the same diatonic structures as the related major key. Thus the context of the chords determines tonality
* The chord built on the 5th scale degree is V-7 which is not a dominant chord
* Typical cadences in natural minor
    * V-7 - I-7
    * IV-7 - I-7
    * bVII7 - I-7
    * II-7b5 - I-7
    * bVImaj7 - I-7

### Harmonic Minor
* Natural minor with a raised 7th degree
* Diatonic chords in harmonic minor:
    * I-(maj7)
    * IIm7b5
    * bIII+maj7
    * IV-7
    * V7
    * bVImaj7
    * VII°7

### Melodic Minor
* Natural minor with a raised 6th and 7th
* Diatonic chords in melodic minor:
    * I-(maj7)
    * II-7
    * bIII+maj7
    * IV7
    * V7
    * VI-7b5
    * VII-7b5
* The IV7 is a dominant structure without dominant function
* **Tensions in minor keys are diatonic to one of the minor scales**

### Secondary and Extended Dominants in Minor Keys
* Secondary and extended dominants may be used in minor keys
* There are more choices for tensions as the 6th and 7th scale degrees may be raised or natural
* IV7 and bVII7 have stronger diatonic function than secondary dominant function

## Line Cliches
* A line cliche is a single line which moves chromatically through a single basic chord
* Example: D-,  D-(maj7),  D-7, D-6. The basic chord here is D-
* Line cliches are common to minor key harmonies
* Characteristics of line cliches
    * They may occur on the top; in the middle; or, if the line cliche starts on the root of the chord, on the bottom of the voicings.
    * They are used as guide tone lines, developed in the voice leading process
    * They always appear in the area of the chord above the 5th and below the root
* Line cliches can change direction
* When there are line cliches, the available tensions are those for the triad
* Examples in major key: I - IV (chromatic up the 5th of one chord to the 5th of the next)

## Modal Interchange
* Modal interchange is the borrowing of diatonic chords from a parallel mode (scale) and using them in the primary key
* The use of minor tonality chords in major key harmonies is a commonly found example of modal interchange. Such chords are borrowed from the parallel minor 
* From natural minor interchange chords borrowed for major key use are: IV-7, bVImaj7, and bVII7
* From harmonic minor: II-7b5, V7(b9), 
* bIIVmaj7 is also common (though not diatonic to any minor key)
* Can also be borrowed from different minor keys (harmonic and melodic)
* Available tensions for modal interchange chords are the same as in the minor context

## Related II-7 Chords
* Related II-7 chord is the chord a fifth above the V7
* Any dominant chord may be preceded by its related II-7 chord
* The related II-7 chord of some secondary dominants will also be diatonic, in this case they have dual function
* Other related II-7 chords which are not diatonic have available tensions from the key of the moment
* II-7 can be II-7b5
* II often appears on the strong beat and V on the weak
* In extended dominant sequences the II chord may be either the chord of resolution or the interpolated prior to the chord of resolution. Example: A-7, D7, G-7… and A-7, D7, D-7, G7

## Blues
* Primary chords in blues are the I7, IV7 and V7
* The primary scale used is the minor pentatonic scale: 1, b3, 4, 5, b7
* b3 and b7 create the ‘bluesy’ sound when played against major chords
* Available tensions for the primary chords are those which appear melodically (minor pentatonic)
* Note that b9 should not be used with #9 on the I7 chord as it is not part of the blues scale
* 12 Bar Blues: 
    * Tonic x4, Subdominant x2, Tonic x4, Dominant 2x, Tonic x2
* Variations to blues demonstrate this pattern in two different ways
* Harmonic motion from and back to the primary chord in each area of the form, and/or
* Harmonic motion to the next primary chord
* bVII7 and #IV°7 are common extra chords 
* Example variation:
    * I7 , VI7 , I7 , I7 , IV7 , #IV°7 , I7 , V7/II , II-7 , V7 , I7 - V7/II/, II-7 - V7

## Substitute Dominants (Tritone Substitution)
* The tritone is the only symmetric interval. If you transpose a dominant chord by a tritone, the original tritone is preserved.
* The substitute dominant is the dominant chord a tritone away from the original. It resolves down a semitone
* Analysis: subV7/I, with a dotted line
* Roots of substitute dominants are not diatonic (primary and secondary dominants are)

### Related II-7 Chords of Substitute Dominants
* Related II-7’s of substitute dominants are non-diatonically rooted
* You can use either the related II-7 chord of the original or the substitute creating 4 possible 2-5-1 progressions:
    * D-7 - G7 - C
    * Ab7 - Db7 - C
    * D-7 - Db7 - C
    * Ab-7 - G7 - C

### Available Tensions of Substitute Dominants
* All substitute dominants have available tensions 9, #11, and 13
* Altered tensions for secondary and primary dominants can be seen as the substitute dominant over the original root
* The available tensions for the related II-7 chords are drawn from the key in which the chord is the diatonic II-7

## Chord Scales
* Used to identify a chord’s available melodic and harmonic pitches. 
* Avoid notes may be used melodically but should be avoided harmonically

### Diatonic
Diatonic chords use diatonic chord scales. Avoid notes in red .

| Mode Name | ½ step between... | Scale degrees relative to ionan |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Ionian | 3-4, 7-1 | 1, 2, 3, <span style="color:red">4</span>, 5, 6, 7 |
| Dorian | 2-3, 6-7 | 1, 2, b3, 4, 5, <span style="color:red">6</span>, b7 |
| Phyrgian | 1-2, 5-6 | 1, <span style="color:red">b2</span>, b3, 4, 5, <span style="color:red">b6</span>, b7  |
| Lydian | 4-5, 7-1 | 1, 2, 3, #4, 5, 6, 7 |
| Mixolydian | 3-4, 6-7 | 1, 2, 3, <span style="color:red">4</span>, 5, 6 ,b7 |
| Aeolian | 2-3, 5-6 | 1, 2, b3, 4, 5, <span style="color:red">b6</span>, b7 |
| Locrian | 1-2, 4-5 | 1, <span style="color:red">b2</span>, b3, 4, b5, b6, b7 |

The avoid note 6 in dorian is the only exception to the major 9th rule

### Dominant Chords
* All secondary dominant chord scales are some form of Mixolydian. Scale degree 4 is an avoid note
* V7/IV and V7/V use Mixolydian
* V7/II uses Mixolydian b13 (b13 is available, violating the major 9th rule)
* V7/III and V7/VI use Mixolydian b9(#9)b13
* Secondary dominants may be altered and the chord scale then becomes altered as well
* Any dominant chord not expected to resolve down a perfect 5th uses Lydian b7
    * Substitute dominants
    * bVII7 (expected resolution up a whole step)

## Deceptive Cadences 
* Commonly V7 - III-7 or V7 - VI-7
* V7 - #IV-7b5
* V7 - any other maj7 modal interchange chords
    * bIIImaj7
    * bVImaj7
    * bIImaj7
* When V7/I resolves deceptively to a modal interchange chord, it most often occurs at a melodic cadence and sounds as though the progression will eventually move to tonic
    * Strongest melodic pitches at cadence are scale degrees 1 and 5
    * All the deceptive cadence chords have either 1 or 5 as a available pitch
* When V7/I resolves deceptively to a maj7 chord, the progression often follows the cycle of fifths to return to tonic
* When V7/I resolves deceptively to #IV-7b5, the progression often continues with chromatically descending motion to the tonic

## Diminished Patterns
* Often found in major keys as linking chords between neighboring diatonic chords (ascending or descending)
* I°7 as auxiliary to the tonic: Imaj7 - I°7 - I6
* V°7 as auxiliary to the dominant: V7 - V°7 - V7
* Diminished chords have 2 tritone intervals, and therefore have a strong demand for resolution (usually by half step to a diatonic chord)
* Ascending diminished 7th chords are derived from secondary dominants of the target chords
* Descending diminished 7th chords are from chromatic voice leading
* It is rare for diminished chords to have a deceptive resolution 
* Available tensions on diminished 7th chords are a major 9th above a chord tone and diatonic

### Chord Scales in Major Keys
| Chord scale | Use case |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Ionian | Imaj7, IVmaj7 (if preceded by V7/IV) |
| Lydian | All other major chords: IVmaj7, bIImaj7, bIIImaj7, bVImaj7, bVIImaj7 |
| Dorian | I-7, IV-7, V-7, II-7. Also, any II-7 chord that appear in a II-V-I context |
| Melodic minor | IV-(maj)7 |
| Locrian natural 9 | II-7b5 |
| Locrian | #IV-7b5 |
| Wholetone | Any chord with a #5 |
| Lydian b7 | Any substitute dominant |

### Chord Scales in Minor Keys
| Chord Scale | Use case |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Melodic Minor | I-6, I-(maj7) |
| Dorian | I-7 |
| Aeolian | I-7 |

* Diatonic chords from minor tonalities have chord scales based on the different tonic scales of those minor keys
* Dominant chords
    * Diatonic root → diatonic non-chord tones
    * Expected resolution down a perfect 5th → some form of Mixolydian
    * Expected resolution not down a perfect 5th → Lydian b7

### Chord Scales in Blues
| Chord scale | Use case |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Mixolydian #9 | I7 |
| Mixolydian | IV7 |
| Mixolydian with some alteration | V7 |
| Mixolydian b9#9b13 | V7/II |

### Summary of Chord Scale Construction
* Any note appearing in a chord scale which is a half step above a chord should be avoided harmonically except b9 and b13 on dominant chords
* 6th degree of dorian should be avoided except in tonic dorian minor context
* Either the 5th or the b13th of a dominant chord should be avoided if the other pitch is used
* Diatonic chords take diatonic scales, with the exception of IV when it is preceded by its dominant or expected to progress to IV-
* Any dominant chord with an expected resolution down a perfect fifth uses some form of Mixolydian or altered chord scale
* Any dominant chord not expected to resolve down a perfect fifth takes a Lydian b7 chord scale
* If a dominant chord’s chord scale is some form of Mixolydian, the scale may have added altered tensions
* Any major chord with a non-diatonic root uses a Lydian scale
* The only alteration to Lydian b7 is #9, if the expected chord of resolution is major
* b9 and #9 may coexist in a Mixolydian scale except on a I chord of the blues.
* Minor 7 chords usually take Dorian
* Most -7b5 chords use Locrian
* All sus4 chords use Mixolydian
* A whole tone scale is used for dominants chords with #5
* Most diminished 7th chords use a chord scale identical to one of the secondary dominant scales

## Modulation
* Modulation is the movement of melodies and/or harmonies from one key into another. In order for a modulation to occur, the listener must shift from the original tonic reference to a new tonic reference
* To indicate modulation use a ↑ with a number indicating the intervallic distance between the primary and the secondary key.
* The use of modulation upwards (e.g. by half step) tends to keep the music ‘forward moving’

### Direct Modulation
* Modulations may occur directly from any diatonic chord. The most common form of direct modulation is from the I chord.
* Direct modulations from diatonic chords other than I or V usually involve stepwise root motion

### Pivot Chord Modulations
* Chords which function in both the primary and secondary key are pivot chords. 
* Chord scale for pivot chords should be based on the chord’s original function

### Dominant Chord Modulations
* The chord of modulation after a dominant 7 chord can have dual function (e.g. a deceptive cadence)
* Example dominant modulations:
    * Down a perfect 5th - G7-Cmaj7
    * Down a half step - G7- Gbmaj7
    * Up a whole step - G7 - Amaj7
    * Down a tritone - G7-Dbmaj7
    * Down a major third - G7 - Ebmaj7
    * Up a half step - G7 - Abmaj7
* Additionally the expected diatonic chord of resolution for a secondary dominant may deceptively change quality and become a chord functioning in the new key.
    * V7/II to new Imaj7
    * V7/III to new Imaj7
    * V7/V to the new Imaj7...etc.
* **Any dominant chord may resolve deceptively into a new key.**

## Contiguous II-V’s
* Contiguous II-Vs have no functional relationship to other chords in the key.
    * They are usually a whole step or half step away from another II-V that is analyzable in a key.
    * This can mean the two II chords as in E-7 A7 F-7 Bb7 Ebmaj7
* Or the first V and the second II as in E-7 A7 Bb-7 Eb7 Abmaj7
* Contiguous II Vs can be used as a reharmonization when there are continuous functional II Vs

## Special Function Dominant Chords

### I7, IV7
* I7 and IV7 can function as tonic and subdominant blues
* IV7 is also diatonic to melodic minor and also has subdominant function in that scenarioZ

### bVII7
* Typically resolves to I

### Subdominant Minor
* Subdominant minor chords are chords that are closely related to IV-7 (from natural minor)
* **The subdominant minor chords are IV-7, II-7b5, and bVImaj7**
* The chords are often used  as modal interchange chords

### bVI7
* Usually analysed as subV7/V
* Can also resolve to I
* This function is derived from the Italian augmented 6th chord

### II7
* II7 and #IVm7b5 are closely related (#IVm7b5 is an extension of II7)
* II7 with the 3rd in the bass can resolve to I with the 5th in the bass or IV or IV-
* II7 in root position can resolve to I or I with the 5th in the bass

### VII7
* Usually V7/III, however it can also resolve to I

## Modal Harmony
* Characteristic note of Dorian mode is natural 6, characteristic chords are in blue and avoid chords are in red.
* Modal harmony does not use subdominant and dominant categories. The I chord is tonic and the others are non-tonic. 
* Diminished and m7b5 chords are avoided in modal chord progressions.
* The dominant 7 chord is also typically avoided as it implies the relative major

| Mode |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dorian | I-7| <span style="color:blue">II-7| bIIImaj7</span>| <span style="color:red">IV7</span>| V-7| <span style="color:red">VIm7b5</span>| <span style="color:blue">bVIImaj7</span>|
| Phyrigian | I-7| <span style="color:blue">bIImaj7</span>| <span style="color:red">bIII7</span>| IV-7| <span style="color:red">Vm7b5</span>| bVImaj7| <span style="color:blue">bVII-7</span>|
| Lydian | Imaj7| <span style="color:red">II7</span>| III-7| <span style="color:red">#IVm7b5</span>| <span style="color:red">Vmaj7</span>| <span style="color:red">Vi-7</span>| <span style="color:blue">VII-7</span>|

Available tensions follow the same diatonic + major 9 above chord tone rules as in major.

## Pedal Point and Ostinato
* Pedal - a single not sustained through a series of chords
* Typically the tonic or dominant note of the key e.g
* Because a sustained pedal point creates a strong feeling of continuity within a key, a high level of tension and dissonance is acceptable above the pedal. Even “wrong” notes sound good if they resolve to available notes.
* Pedal notes are usually in the bass but also possible as internal and soprano.
* Ostinato - A repeated figure involving more than one note is called an ostinato. Usually in the bass, but can be written in other ranges as well
* Ostinatos typically emphasize the tonic of the key and often employ strong rhythmic ideas.
* Ostinatos are useful in establishing a strong sense of tonality in modal contexts, emphasising both the tonic and characteristic notes of the mode

## Compound Chord Symbols

### Chord over a chord
* A chord over a chord is called an upper structure triad or upper structure seventh chord. Notes of the upper structure are interpreted as upper extensions of the chord below
    * E.g. Gb/C7 is the same as C7(b9b5)

### Chord over a bass note
* An inversion
* Hybrid structures - When the bass note is not the 3rd, 5th or 7 th of the upper structure the voicing is interpreted as a hybrid structure. C-7/F is not C-7 over its 11th, because the eat does not perceive bass notes as tensions. The voicing actually sounds like F7sus4
* A hybrid voicing typically does not contain the third of the chord it represents. This makes them sound ambiguous (major? Or minor?)
    * Typical hybrids: G/C, A-7/D, Cmaj7/F

### Analysis of Compound Chord Symbols
* A chord over a chord is analysed in terms of the function of the lower structure
* An inversion is analysed as if it were in root position
* A hybrid is analysed as if the bass note is the root of the chord

### Hybrid Construction
* Choose potential melody notes to be harmonized with hybrids; these are typically notes of long duration
* Analyze the progression to determine the appropriate chord scales
* Determine which triads and sevenths chords can be used as upper structures above the root. Melody notes must be 1, 3, 5, 7 of the upper structure
    * The upper structure is usually a major or minor triad
    * The upper structure must contain only notes from the chord scale of the moment
    * The upper structure should not contain any 3rd or the root.
    * Relative dissonance or blandness is controlled by the intervals between the root and the notes of the upper structure
    
## Constant Structure Chord Progressions
Constant structure chord progression - A series of chords of all the same type such as

Fmaj7 - Bbmaj7 - Ebmaj7 - Abmaj7 - Dbmaj7 - Gbmaj7 - Fmaj7

* Two perspectives of analysis: 
    * Functional in the key of F
    * Non-functional analysis - The listener may hear the pattern of motion down descending perfect 5ths more clearly than the harmonic functions in the key.
* Constant structure chord progressions usually end with root motion that is stepwise or down a perfect 5th
* Root motion can be either of consistent interval, or a pattern of 2 or 3 intervals
