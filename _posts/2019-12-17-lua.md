Lua is my favorite track on Jacob Collier's album Djesse vol. 2. Everything about the song is just so delicious - from the lush strings, to the amazingly smooth voice of MARO, to the serene solo. In this post I'll talk a bit about MARO's guitar playing in the verse. We'll focus on the section just as MARO begins to sing (and play) - around 0:26 - 2:05. Here is the [transcription for the guitar part](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/njkgf3edinew2mm/lua.pdf?dl=0).

# Harmony
Something you'll notice is that the bass notes are typically omitted (left for the bass player), so the guitar can focus on playing more extensions of the chord, rather than doubling the bass. The chords are mainly diatonic to Db with several non-diatonic extensions. Functionally, the chord progression is I, II7, II-, V, I, and then III-, VI-, II7, II-7, V, first time ending in II-, V7, and second time ending in I.

The voicing for Db69 is pretty interesting sounding, it is an example of a quartal voicing on the guitar, as it is stacked perfect fourths starting from F. It is clearly the "I", as the bass emphasizes the root Db, however, when played in isolation, it sounds pretty ambiguous.

The second chord Eb79#11, is a dominant chord on the second scale degree (II7), which is a non-diatonic chord. It sometimes plays the role the secondary dominant (V/V) however, in this case it resolves to the to the (II-). This resolution is very popular in jazz and even pop music. Some examples of this are the intro and the bridge to "When I Was Your Man" by Bruno Mars, the end of the A section to the jazz standard "There Will Never Be Another You".

Something I like a lot about these chords is how well they seem to transition to each other. In particular the chords are voice-led so that often there will be common tones that don't change, which gives the progression a very smooth sound. This voice leading is apparent when playing the chords as certain fingers stay on the same frets between chords.

# Rhythm
This piece has a slow bossa nova feel, supported by the bass, guitar, and drums. The guitar plays a repeating two bar rhythm:
