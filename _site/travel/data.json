            "Something that immediately caught my attention about LA was the abundance of these dubious lollipop-shaped trees. How do these things keep their balance? How do they not topple over regularly? I mean they're so tall and yet so skinny and you can even see them waving around in the wind! ",
            "LA has some nice hikes that are super accessible from the city. Early in the week, I went on two hikes. One to Runyon Canyon, and another to the famous Griffith Observatory. <br><br> Runyon Canyon is right above Hollywood and the walk of fame. The hike was short but challenging. Although it's right next to a city, you still get some nice views and nature-y vibes. At the top, I also got to see the famous Mulholland Drive before completing the loop. <br><br> Griffith Observatory was a very similar hike with similar views, except you get closer to the iconic Hollywood sign. During the hike, I encountered a group of people riding horses up the mountain. ",

            "In the second half of the week, I went to Santa Monica. It reminded me a little bit of Palo Alto but by the beach and with more energy and young people and better public transportation.  Loved it here, it was so beautiful even though it was super cloudy for most of the time I was there. <br><br> After exploring the beach and the town I went for a hike in the Santa Monica Mountains which was the nicest of the three hikes I did this week. There were fewer people and you can see the ocean! Stopped by Malibu on the way back too. <br><br> Also, my Airbnb host Liz was the absolute nicest 70-year-old artist who made coffee and gave me snacks when she heard I wanted to go on a hike. <br><br> I used to think NYC was easily my favorite city in the US but LA is making me doubt. It has all the perks of being a big city but with much better beaches and access to nature.",

            "One of the main reasons I wanted to come to LA was the food, and it did not disappoint. The  journey started in the Grand Central Market in downtown LA. Here are some highlights! <br><br> Other places not included here that I tried were Burgerlords in Chinatown, The Grain Cafe, and Shojin which were all excellent but I just forgot to take pictures. Overall, LA is super vegan friendly and I'd almost certainly eat way too much here :).",
            "The vegan ramen at Ramenhood was legit probably the best thing I've eaten all year. So flavorful. The omnipork was very good, the mushrooms were fantastic, and the texture of the noodles was incredibly satisfying. The broth was made from sunflower seeds if you can believe that! I didn't like the vegan egg very much but other than that it was bomb. I tried to go again on my last day in la since the train station is nearby but they were closed :(",

            "Right next to Ramenhood was 'McConnell's Fine Icecream'. I had a scoop of their dairy-free eureka lemon and marionberries ice cream and it was delicious. Probably the second-best vegan ice cream I've had. The best is still the lemon cheesecake from Salt & Straw from whichever month where it was the special. <br><br> Also in Grand Central Market was PBJLA which is a stall that specializes in the humble peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I got the Superfood which had cacao nib almond butter, blueberry, acai, and goji berry jam. It's essentially an uncrustible if it went to culinary school, moved to LA, and got into all the SoCal health trends. Yes, I did spend $8 on a peanut butter and jelly sandwich - and it was worth it.

            "Another place I visited in DTLA was Donut Friend which specialized in vegan donuts. Basically a regular donut shop where all the donuts were vegan, and they also had ice cream. The guy there was very nice and offered me many samples of ice cream which were all delicious. I went for the pistachio ice cream with a chocolate caramel donut. I recommend getting them separately though since when I ate them together, their flavors kinda canceled out and I only tasted sweetness.",

            "I decided to treat myself one night and went to a fancier restaurant called Plant Food and Wine in Santa Monica. At first, I was a little disappointed by the kimchi dumplings (which were tiny and sour) and the fettuccine (which was too oily for my taste). However, that all changed when I had the dessert titled 'Chocolate + Mint'. it was so damn good. Everything about it was perfect. The rich and creamy chocolate cream contrasted with the cool and refreshing mint ice cream. The delightfully crunchy bits of chocolate cookie. The surprise ball of caramel in the center. Mhmm highly recommend it. ",
            "I stopped by Santa Monica on my way back from a trip to San Diego with some good friends. We didn't get to explore much but we got some lunch at this place called 'Thai Vegan'. It was really good so I was delighted to randomly stumble upon it when I was wandering through the town. Their pad thai is really good. Fresh, sweet, sour, slightly charred tofu, delicious. ",

The plan is to spend each week in the next 9 weeks in a different city. <br><br> Although I'll be spending a lot of time exploring, I have a bunch of other non-travel-related stuff to do too such as teaching, looking for an apartment, and working on research. <br><br> I'll be taking the Amtrak trains which I'm super excited about.
