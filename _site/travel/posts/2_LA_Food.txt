    "1" : "One of the main reasons I wanted to come to LA was the food, and it did not disappoint. The  journey started in the Grand Central Market in downtown LA. Here are some highlights! <br><br> Other places not included here that I tried were Burgerlords in Chinatown, The Grain Cafe, and Shojin which were all excellent but I just forgot to take pictures. Overall, LA is super vegan friendly and I'd almost certainly eat way too much here :).",
    "2" : "The vegan ramen at Ramenhood was legit probably the best thing I've eaten all year. So flavorful. The omnipork was very good, the mushrooms were fantastic, and the texture of the noodles was incredibly satisfying. The broth was made from sunflower seeds if you can believe that! I didn't like the vegan egg very much but other than that it was bomb. I tried to go again on my last day in la since the train station is nearby but they were closed :(",
    "4": "Right next to Ramenhood was 'McConnell's Fine Icecream'. I had a scoop of their dairy-free eureka lemon and marionberries ice cream and it was delicious. Probably the second-best vegan ice cream I've had. The best is still the lemon cheesecake from Salt & Straw from whichever month where it was the special. <br><br> Also in Grand Central Market was PBJLA which is a stall that specializes in the humble peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I got the Superfood which had cacao nib almond butter, blueberry, acai, and goji berry jam. It's essentially an uncrustible if it went to culinary school, moved to LA, and got into all the SoCal health trends. Yes, I did spend $8 on a peanut butter and jelly sandwich - and it was worth it. ",
    "6": "Another place I visited in DTLA was Donut Friend which specialized in vegan donuts. Basically a regular donut shop where all the donuts were vegan, and they also had ice cream. The guy there was very nice and offered me many samples of ice cream which were all delicious. I went for the pistachio ice cream with a chocolate caramel donut. I recommend getting them separately though since when I ate them together, their flavors kinda canceled out and I only tasted sweetness.",
    "8": "I decided to treat myself one night and went to a fancier restaurant called Plant Food and Wine in Santa Monica. At first, I was a little disappointed by the kimchi dumplings (which were tiny and sour) and the fettuccine (which was too oily for my taste). However, that all changed when I had the dessert titled 'Chocolate + Mint'. it was so damn good. Everything about it was perfect. The rich and creamy chocolate cream contrasted with the cool and refreshing mint ice cream. The delightfully crunchy bits of chocolate cookie. The surprise ball of caramel in the center. Mhmm highly recommend it. ",
    "9": "I stopped by Santa Monica on my way back from a trip to San Diego with some good friends. We didn't get to explore much but we got some lunch at this place called 'Thai Vegan'. It was really good so I was delighted to randomly stumble upon it when I was wandering through the town. Their pad thai is really good. Fresh, sweet, sour, slightly charred tofu, delicious. "
