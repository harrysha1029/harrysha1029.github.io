    "1" : "Something that immediately caught my attention about LA was the abundance of these dubious lollipop-shaped trees. How do these things keep their balance? How do they not topple over regularly? I mean they're so tall and yet so skinny and you can even see them waving around in the wind! ",
    "2" : "LA has some nice hikes that are super accessible from the city. Early in the week, I went on two hikes. One to Runyon Canyon, and another to the famous Griffith Observatory. <br><br> Runyon Canyon is right above Hollywood and the walk of fame. The hike was short but challenging. Although it's right next to a city, you still get some nice views and nature-y vibes. At the top, I also got to see the famous Mulholland Drive before completing the loop. <br><br> Griffith Observatory was a very similar hike with similar views, except you get closer to the iconic Hollywood sign. During the hike, I encountered a group of people riding horses up the mountain. ",
    "4" : "In the second half of the week, I went to Santa Monica. It reminded me a little bit of Palo Alto but by the beach and with more energy and young people and better public transportation.  Loved it here, it was so beautiful even though it was super cloudy for most of the time I was there. <br><br> After exploring the beach and the town I went for a hike in the Santa Monica Mountains which was the nicest of the three hikes I did this week. There were fewer people and you can see the ocean! <br><br> Also, my Airbnb host Liz was the absolute nicest 70-year-old artist who made coffee and gave me snacks when she heard I wanted to go on a hike. <br><br> I used to think NYC was easily my favorite city in the US but LA is making me doubt. It has all the perks of being a big city but with much better beaches and access to nature."
