# Hello! 
I recently graduated from Stanford University (B.S. in Math, M.S. in CS), and will be starting my PhD in the fall of 2021. Before that, I'll be doing a mixture of playing music, working on personal projects, and travelling :)

# Research
I'm mainly interested in theoretical CS, especially cryptography and complexity theory. In the past I have also done research in psychology/neuroscience. Here are some papers that I've worked on:

* [*Prime implicants of CNF formulas*](/resources/cnfs_paper.pdf)
    * Milan Moss&eacute;, **Harry Sha**, Li-Yang
* [*Reappraising faces: effects on accountability appraisals, self-reported valence, and pupil diameter*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30092708/)
    * Jennifer Yih, **Harry Sha**, Danielle E. Beam, Josef Parvizi, James J. Gross
    * (Cognition and Emotion, 2018) 

# Teaching
* Teaching Assistant for CS 255 - Introduction to Cryptography (Winter 2020, Winter 2021)
* Teaching Assistant for CS 103 - Mathematical Foundations of Computing (Summer 2020, Fall 2020)
  * Made searchable resource with key definitions and theorems: [CS103 Oracle](https://cs103oracle.netlify.app)
* Curriculum developer at [Inspirit AI](https://www.inspiritai.com/)
  * [Game playing AI - the minimax algorithm and variants](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/178WCS3ZlQCnMqtIfhuzaTh6nITSp9hS0?authuser=2)
  * [Segmentation of lung x-rays](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1S7FP0NW02RNROfJh93GN6yMUDWnpUbWk?usp=sharing)
  * [Self-driving cars with reinforcement learning](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jrDRhS6GzCZs8DfUfwNdI8mw0FZwogj7?authuser=2)

# Random Projects
Here are some random projects that I have worked on. 

* For *Math 231 - Mathematics and Statistics of Gambling*, I did an [analysis of the card guessing game: 'riding the bus'](/resources/bus.pdf).
* For *CS 248 - Interactive Computer Graphics*, Ashley Nguyen and I wrote a L-System compiler to generate fractals and animations. Check out the generated graphics [here](https://l-systems.netlify.app/).
* [Code to work with and visualize *k*-CNFs used in my research](https://github.com/harrysha1029/sat). Developed with Milan Moss&eacute;.

# Fun/Random
I love to play and listen to music, run, cook, play tennis, and watch movies/tv :)

* I have a [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVjPFH1nsdSB03heP0Al36A) with some random music stuff.
* I'm a big Roger Federer fan.
* I'm a big Jacob Collier fan.
