# Hello! 
I'm a college student and aspiring researcher from Beijing. Currently, I'm working toward a M.S. in Computer Science at Staford University. This quarter I'm taking classes in randomized algorithms, and the mathematics and statistics of gambling. I'm also working as a TA for [CS 103: Mathematical Foundations of Computing](http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs103/cs103.1208/handouts/overview.html), and as an instructor for the [Inspirit AI](https://www.inspiritai.com/) program. 

# Research
I'm mainly interested in theoretical CS, especially complexity theory, cryptography and logic. In the past I have also done research in psychology/neuroscience. Here are some papers that I've worked on:

* [*CNF Formulas and Their Prime Implicants*](l)
    * Milan Mosse, **Harry Sha**, Li-Yang
* [*Reappraising faces: effects on accountability appraisals, self-reported valence, and pupil diameter*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30092708/)
    * Jennifer Yih, **Harry Sha**, Danielle E. Beam, Josef Parvizi, James J. Gross
    * (Cognition and Emotion, 2018) 

# Teaching
