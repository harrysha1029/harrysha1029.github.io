### Guitar
Been playing since highschool. Huge fan of Andy Mckee, Don Ross, Thomas Leeb and Julian Lage . Played a lot of fingerstyle back in the day but more recently exploring other styles like jazz, songwriting and classical!

### Side By Side
Side By Side is a singing group that I joined in college. We sing music from the 20's to the 60's at local nursing homes. They are the best!

### YouTube
I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVjPFH1nsdSB03heP0Al36A?view_as=subscriber) where I occasionally post low production quality guitar tutorials, music analysis and other random stuff :D.

### Plane
My parents live in Beijing and I go to school in California, resulting in a lot of plane rides over the past couple of years. I always try to get the window seat.
