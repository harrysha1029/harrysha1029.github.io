# Hello! 

Hi I'm Harry, welcome to my website! I'm a college student from Beijing. I like math, computer science, teaching, music, sports, cooking, games, and movies :)

Currently, I'm a senior at Stanford University studying math and CS and also the co-music director for the singing group Side By Side. During the COVID pandemic, I have decided to take the quarter off to complete an internship at Locus Analytics.
